 * Exam objective 2.5 Developr code that uses wrapper classes such as
 * Boolean, Double and Integer
 * @author noelf
 *Wrapper classes are in built classes that "Wrap" primitive variables
 *in a class. Each primitive variable type has a corresponding wrapper class
 *an int has an Integer
 *byte has a Byte
 *short has a Short
 *long has a Long
 *double has a Double
 *float has a Float
 *char has a Character
 *boolean has a Boolean
 *Remember String is NOT A PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE, but an array of characters
 *and its "String" with a capital "S", there is no such things as a 
 *"string" data type
 *
